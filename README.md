This is a mini project that can keep track of your events.
The technology stack is: MERN

To run this repository, follow the following steps:

*  Go to the directory where the project has been cloned using: `cd eventManagement`
*  Install `npm package`, `mongodb`.
*  Execute the following command: `npm i`. This will install all the dependencies in a folder known as `node_modules`.
*  In the terminal type: `nodemon`
*  Run Mongodb in your localhost at port 27017 using the command: `mongod --dbpath <path of directory where you want to store your database>`
*  Run webpack to generate the `bundle.js` file by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `webpack`

If everything goes fine, open your web browser and go to the following link: `localhost:3000`

Hope you never miss any event from now on with your own personal `event_Manage`

for additional queries, please create an issue and comment with as much details as you can.
Feel free to add more features by creating a seperate branch. I would be more than happy to help :)
